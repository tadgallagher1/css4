Victor Stuesse wins Lacie Award

Victor Stuesse is the recipient of this year’s Lacie Award, dedicated to honoring the work of a professor who has touched lives both inside and outside of the Roux community. As a teacher, Professor Stuesse has ushered over 900 students through the Craft + Design program, and has always been willing to share the secrets of his craft. As a sculptor and restorer, he has donated his time to public works projects such as the Central Park Arts Maintenance Council and the Metropolitan Museum’s docent program.

Professor Stuesse has had a long and successful career in the arts, having received many commissions over the years in cities from Chicago to Bangkok, but always returns to “the job I call a dream.” For his dedication to teaching and community involvement, the Roux Academy is proud to award him with this year’s prize, which also includes a stipend for pursuit of personal projects outside the academy. Congratulations, Professor Stuesse!

Student Spotlight

Gerald Chow

Gerald Chow will graduate from Roux Academy this spring with a BFA and a painting concentration. He took his longtime interest in graffiti and street art and has translated it to the canvas in cartoonish, graphical pictures. Chow’s work is becoming increasingly more recognized, winning Excellence Awards in both the 2010 and 2011 Fine Arts Shows at RAA. After receiving his degree, Chow is moving to San Francisco to join the graphic design team PURCHASE as a junior art designer.

“I’m fascinated with urban artwork. Unlike pieces you find in a museum, they become a living part of the environment they inhabit and create a running dialog with the viewer.”

Programs

Individual learners are at the core of Roux’s academic program. The curriculum for each grade and each subject is structured to meet the needs of students at that age and stage of development, based on the latest brain research. Small classes enable teachers to give students personal attention and to engage all learners fully in every class session.

The core of our program is a strong traditional platform of reading, writing, and mathematics instruction. Our goal is excellence without compromise in these areas; we are committed to building the best writing and mathematics programs anywhere. We want our students to not only be excellent writers, but to be published. In math, we want our students to compete with students around the world.

You'll find the supportive environment at Roux encourages collaboration and creates enthusiasm among our students. Our teachers help you develop and push your creative boundaries, while giving you the space and time to explore your subject area and to find your own style. Join Roux Academy and join a community that’s dedicated to helping you reach your highest artistic and creative potential.

Alumni Association

Dear Roux Alumni,

Welcome to the Alumni Association’s section of the school’s website!

Established in 2009, the association was started with the hope of re-connecting former students to their alma mater, and helping you renew old friendships and connections. For some of the older alums, you may be surprised at the evolution of the school in just the last ten years; more recent graduates will appreciate the ability to stay in touch with former teachers and friends.

Through our page on Facebook, and the school’s website, we’ll keep you up-to-date; however, it’s just as important that we hear from you. Please email us (alumni@roux.org) with updates so we can include them in future alumni publications. Graduating from college, starting a new job, getting married – we want to keep up with and celebrate the milestones in your life.

The first step, however, is to get current contact information from everyone. Feel free to e-mail your physical address and phone number to the school so we can keep you up-to-date with what other alums are up to. We currently are looking for class representatives who would like to be their class’ spokesperson. If this is something you are interested in doing, please let us know.

We encourage you to stop by the “new” campus you are welcome any time.

Please take a moment to fill out the short form below to provide us with information for our alumni database. Only your first and last name, class year, and email address are required, but we would love to have additional information if you would like to complete the entire form.
Thank you.
